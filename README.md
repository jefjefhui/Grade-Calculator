# Grade-Calculator


Grade Calculator 

-The grade calculator application is developed in Python. In addition, I used Pycharm as the IDE.

-Exams and projects are not dropped 

-Quiz, assignment, and exercise can be dropped 

The grade calculator is an application which helps students to calculate their CIS345 class scores at the end of the semester. The grade calculator calculates your CIS345 scores based on the grading criteria and the assessments items. 

There are 6 assessment items in total, which are exercise, assignment, project, quiz, exam and finals. 

There are special rules on the calculation. Students can drop their lowest score on quiz, assignment and exercise. But exam and project scores cannot be dropped. After dropping the lowest score on your quizzes, assignments and exercises, the scores that will be counted to your final grade is finalized.

Afterwards, you need to calculate the total points you got in each assessment category. These total points are the input data to the application, and we need to enter them in the application.

Once all the input data is ready, we can run the program. When the program runs, it will ask for the total points you earned in each assessment category. Users need to enter the points accordingly. 

After all the points are entered, the program will calculate your grade by category. The grade you earned in each category is based on the points you earned,the total available points in each category and the weight of the category to the final grade. 

The program will display a table, which clearly shows the category, points earned, total points, weight and grade.
Finally, the program will calculate your final grade of the course and print out the value.
